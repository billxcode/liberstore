## Install the Application

* Clone Repository

       git clone [this repo]
    
* Update Composer
   
       composer update
       
* Run Server
    
       php -S localhost:8000 [enter]

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

     php composer.phar create-project slim/slim-skeleton [my-app-name]

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
